Learning Objectives

1. Build a logistic regression model, structured as a shallow neural network.
2. Implement the main steps of an ML algorithm, including making predictions, derivative computation, and gradient descent.
3. Implement computationally efficient, highly vectorized, versions of models.
4. Understand how to compute derivatives for logistic regression, using a backpropagation mindset.
5. Become familiar with Python and Numpy.
6. Work with iPython Notebooks.
7. Be able to implement vectorization across multiple training examples.
